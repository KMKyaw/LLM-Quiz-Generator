continents which sit at over 30. it is the second largest continent in the world as well and was home to the richest man to have ever lived the tallest fastest and overall biggest land animals are from this beautiful continent often overlooked in history africa the home of over three thousand ethnic groups and over two thousand languages deserves more than ten minutes so we urge you to use this video as a stepping stone to more advanced topics fossils strewn about the african landscape tell researchers all they need to know we can use these to trace back our human lineage to over 7 million years ago our own species homo sapiens would begin to emerge just 350 000 years ago and would undertake a migration known as the out of africa migration around 50 000 years ago sending humans all across the globe the sahara once lush and green would experience a drying period beginning in 5000 bce and increasing due to a shift in the earth's axis around 3500 bce eventually becoming a desert this caused early humans to leave the sahara and move to the nile valley before agriculture the hunter-gatherers would begin to domesticate cattle the donkey and goats [Music] the region would eventually become egypt and is one of the few areas of the world to have independently developed a writing system with their first pharaoh taking power around 3100 bce egypt would become one of the longest lasting civilizations they would fall to the acamenide empire under the persians but soon in 322 bce alexander the great greeted as a liberator would conquer not only egypt but the entire persian empire egypt would continue under the greek ptolemaic dynasty following alexander's death during this time another north african power would come to prominence they were the carthaginians based in carthage founded by settlers from finisher who would come to be known as punics these mediterranean sea traders would rival rome and that would be the cause of their ultimate demise with rome utterly destroying the north african civilization later with the roman empire that region would be named the province of africa procontillaris septimius severus who was half punic himself became the first roman emperor of african descent the 1st century ce were marked by the spread of christianity in africa in the regions closest to judea like egypt nubia and the aksamite empire in the 600s though islam would sweep through north africa the berbers living west of egypt would convert to the new faith and it would begin to spread southwards through trade routes in west africa we believe the monday-speaking peoples to have discovered agriculture independently and created numerous urban centres like dartishi and walata a bit to the east january jaina was settled around 300 bce and grew to be one of the most important urban centres in sub-saharan africa around present-day nigeria in 1500 bce the knock culture would thrive creating impressive terracotta figures of humans and other animals [Music] africa didn't have a period of middle ages like europe but the period from the 800s to 1700s was one of relative stability to the south where the bushmen or san peoples living decentralized hunter-gatherer lifestyles in central africa the bantu speakers would expand all throughout southern and eastern africa some of these bantu speakers the swahilis would establish trading towns on the eastern coast [Music] west africa the sahel in particular is where africa's most prominent kingdoms and empires would take hold amassing their wealth through trading routes on the sahara apart from the older ghana empire and canaan borneo empire the mali empire would become the most famous through the wealth accumulated by mansa musa after the empire became fragmented sunny ali would take control of the territory and trading routes in the 1400s founding the saul high empire the largest in africa islam would then become its official religion soon after in north africa tribal confederacies from arabia migrated westwards into the lands of the berbers this caused a mix of culture with the berbers becoming arabized [Music] while slavery had already been present in africa with the trans-sahara slave trade swahili coast trade and barbary coast it struck another gear between the 15th to 19th centuries with the atlantic slave trade in total europeans would take up to 12 million africans to the americas as slave labor in the 1800s the decline in the slave trade along with the presence of royal navy patrols on the coast caused west africa to adapt to more legitimate markets the ashanti empire and kingdom of daryl may who played a large part in the slave trade would now focus on timber gold palm oil and cocoa anti-slavery treaties were also signed with numerous other leaders in africa during the new imperialism period in the late 1800s after the berlin conference of 1884 africa was divided up between european nations and the scramble for africa would take place in the mid to late 1800s europeans only controlled 10 percent of african territory but by 1914 they would have a staggering 90 percent under their control only liberia and arguably ethiopia were spared colonization after world war ii a wave of decolonization occurred and native africans took back their land in mass independence movements ghana was the first sub-saharan country to achieve this in 1957 portugal's presence in africa would date back to the 1500s and finally come to an end over 400 years later in south africa however independence wasn't granted to the native majority but to the dutch minority who still ruled under an apartheid system until 1994. in part due to the arbitrary boundaries europeans divided africa into the continent modern history has been hampered by instability as the european military was a constant and stabilizing force albeit oppressive this same form of government was seen as the most effective military dictatorships would dominate africa during the latter half of the 20th century this period would see an unlucky 13 presidential assassinations in 1994 perhaps remnants of the european favouritism of the tutsis the rwandan genocide would occur resulting in an estimated 1.1 million deaths another tragic event the second congo war beginning in 1998 was estimated to have directly killed 350 000 and a staggering 5.4 million indirectly the 21st century though would see africa emerge with a new destiny ravaged by centuries of colonialism exploitation and political corruption new economic investment in africa is giving the continent new hope investments are notably by china even if this can be seen as neo-colonialism but it's still seen as preferable to the violent hard imperialism of the past what currently threatens africa the most however is climate change and it will take a global effort to change course one we have no choice but to take the story of africa is one of great sadness but also great triumph it is one of the most beautiful continents on earth home to numerous species including our own we are still making discoveries in our homeland to piece together our untold past but for this land the origin of millions of years of our ancestral history it's truly the future that shines brightest [Music] ,1230

Thailand's monarchs, thanks to strict laws
restricting reporting on the Thai royals. However, King Rama X
isn't a complete mystery. From marrying his bodyguard to flying his own plane and throwing a four-day
funeral for his pet poodle, here's everything we know about
Thailand's eccentric ruler. King Rama X was born on July 28, 1952. His full name means ""adorned
with jewels or thunderbolts."" He was educated first at a
palace school in Bangkok, then prep and boarding
schools in the United Kingdom, before completing his overseas education at the Royal Military College at Duntroon in Canberra, Australia. After graduating, the
prince joined the Thai army. He underwent advanced military training not only in Thailand, but also the UK, US, and Australia, becoming an officer and qualified pilot for both civilian and military aircrafts. According to the BBC, the king still flies his own Boeing 737 when
he travels overseas. Despite his military
training, there were questions of whether the prince was fit to rule. Rumors of gambling, womanizing, and associating with illegal
businesses reportedly plagued the prince's reputation. In 1977, he married his first cousin, but then got involved with a young actress with whom he had five children before the two married in 1994. But just two years later,
he publicly denounced her and disowned his four sons. In 2001, he married his third wife, a lady-in-waiting, but took away her royal title in 2014 and arrested nine of her
relatives, including her parents, on charges that they'd abused
their connection to him. After his father passed
away in October 2016, the prince ascended Thailand's throne and became King Rama X, the 10th monarch of his royal house. In order to allow time for
Thailand to mourn his father, he waited three years for his coronation. And three days before
the highly anticipated and lavish affair in May 2019, the king married his fourth wife. The palace had never acknowledged the king's longtime romantic relationship with the woman who helped
command his bodyguards before. But now, she was his queen. The queen joined the king for
his coronation festivities. The procession, which
involved 1,300 people and elephants, took six and a half hours and reportedly cost the
government $31 million. The South China Morning Post reported that the king wore a 15-pound crown and was carried on a
palanquin by 16 people, who changed every 500 meters. Just two months later, he made his rumored longtime girlfriend, a major general, his royal noble consort. The televised ceremony took place on the king's 67th birthday, with the queen at his side. When the Thai royal palace
later published a photo of the king's consort wearing a crop top and piloting a plane, its
official website crashed. According to The Times, King Rama X is Thailand's first modern monarch to openly have more than one partner. However, in October
2019, the king stripped his royal noble consort of
her title, citing disloyalty. According to the royal
palace's official statement, she was ""ambitious,"" her
behavior was ""disrespectful,"" and she tried to ""elevate herself to the same state as the queen."" The statement also said
that the king's consort had attempted to prevent
the queen's coronation. The king stripped his former consort of all royal titles and decorations, as well as status in the royal guard and military ranks. Although Thailand is a
constitutional monarchy, the king wields much power. He commands an estimated 5,000 troops in the royal guard and has much influence over the wealthy Crown Property Bureau,
which provides the palace with an annual income
of about $300 million. Not to mention, as
king, he can pretty much do whatever he wants. Including naming his pet poodle Foo Foo an air chief marshal. When Foo Foo died, the king gave him a four-day-long Buddhist funeral. Despite his responsibilities in Thailand, he reportedly spends a
large amount of his time at his home in the
German state of Bavaria. An avid cyclist, the king has led a number of biking events in Bangkok, but if you see him out, think twice before snapping a picture. When a photo of the king
was posted on Facebook showing him wearing a crop top, he threatened to sue Facebook, saying the images were insulting. Thailand's lèse-majesté
law subjects anyone who ""defames, insults
or threatens the king the queen, the
heir-apparent or the regent"" to a jail term of three to 15 years. The same law allowed the king to imprison his third wife's parents
for two and a half years on charges of ""royal defamation"" and also imprison a Thai
man for 35 years in 2017 for insulting the monarchy on Facebook. At least two people arrested
on royal defamation charges have been found dead under
mysterious circumstances. The United Nations' rights body has issued a warning that Thailand's
use of lèse-majesté might ""constitute crimes
against humanity."" The legislation has been
in effect since Thailand's first criminal code was created in 1908. And the military-backed government says the law is needed
to protect the monarchy. ",852

over two million hindu temples one of which is the karni mata temple known as the residence of over thousand rats all revered and considered holy but more in line with our purposes india is home to one of the planet's first civilizations we have found remains of modern humans on the subcontinent dating to around 30 000 years ago but there is evidence humans migrated there in phases originating from further west around 55 000 years back during the neolithic permanent settlements were built in northwest india near present-day pakistan by around 3300 the first urban cultures would emerge based around the indus river valley this was one of the six main cradles of civilization the ancient indus civilization or harapan hit its peak around 2500 to 1900 bce with its city centers like mohenjo-daro harappa and olavira this civilization is thought to have had a population of over 5 million people the indus valley civilization is notable for its cities which were some of the largest and most sophisticated of their time the civilization also developed a system of writing which has yet to be deciphered it's possible drought or famine displaced this civilization as many of their cities were abandoned and eventually replaced by the vedic civilization this civilization was located in the same general region as the indus valley the vedic civilization lasted from about 1500 to 500 bce this civilization is notable for its development of hinduism which is still the largest religion in india after the abandonment of the urban indus settlements the vedic culture began to urbanize along north west india and the ganges plain and eventually coalesce into 16 kingdoms and oligarchies called the mahajanapadas unlike the indus valley civilization which was fairly egalitarian there was more hierarchy and income inequality in these new kingdoms two newer religious movements emerged from this jainism based on the teachings of mahavira and buddhism based on the teachings of gautama buddha by the late 300s bce one of these sixteen kingdoms magadha annexed most of the region and founded the mauryan empire on paper they controlled almost the entire subcontinent minus the very south one of their kings ashoka was responsible for the spread of buddhism all across the empire during the mauryan rule to the north south india would be ruled by the three crowned rulers or three tamil kings they traded extensively with neighbours to the south east and as far as rome by the early 300s the guptas forged an empire in northern india along the indo-gangetic plain they brought in a golden age for india reforming and renewing hinduism leading a growth of culture visible in their architecture and art it was a period of literature and progression of science astronomy and mathematics india would be the world's largest economy for almost two thousand years the gupta empire would dissolve by the mid 500s during a barbarian invasion ending india's classical age early medieval india would be split up into numerous rival areas and dynasties three of the largest would be engaged in the tripartite struggle a war for northern india by the 900s the pratiharas took full control of the city of canaj in the south the cholas gained prominence exerting influence on sri lanka and other islands in southeast asia merchants traveled from india all over the indian ocean around the year 1000 during india's late medieval period muslim nomadic clans from central asia began raiding the north they took over the northern region by 1206 establishing the delhi sultanate after raids to the south they also gained control of most of the subcontinent but they allowed most of the local population to keep their own traditions during the mongol invasions the delhi sultanate fought off the mongols but failed to keep the south as the native indian vijayanagara empire was formed by 1336 [Music] modern warfare fell upon the delhi sultanate during the modern period by 1526 they were subdued by other central asian raiders this time using gunpowder these new muslim rulers then established the mughal empire to quell rebellion they allowed some natives to join the administrative class the mughals were inspired by the neighbouring persian culture resulting in personalized architecture and giving the emperor a divine status because of the period's relative stability art flourished once again and the economy expanded different native groups would form though and attempt to take back india from the muslim invaders in the punjab the sikh empire formed under ranjit singh his army and administration incorporated hindus sikhs muslims and europeans and was instrumental in fending off invasions from afghanistan the mughals lost most of their power and territory though from the maratha by the 1700s trading posts from europe had been established along the coast the most prominent was the east india company from britain teaming up with a few self-interested locals the company began military and administrative operations and eventually by the mid-1700s achieved company rule over india it then continued to subdue other indian regions for decades india was no longer able to sell its raw materials to other nations directly they were only allowed to supply the british this forced natives to focus on other pursuits like education and cultural achievements by the mid-1800s the east india company had established a capital at calcutta and became more involved in affairs they brought over british advancements like the railway system and telegraph but it came at a cost land taxes were predatory and british social reform was seen as intrusive to indian culture this prompted the indian rebellion in 1857 while it was suppressed by 1858 it caused the british to abolish company rule and take control of india directly as the british raj in 1885 the indian national council was founded as a result of nationalist movements all over india and would continue to grow over the next century during world war one india was called to fight as a british colony to stop any insurgencies during this time the british implemented harsh laws which were extended even after the war like the rolat act which allowed for indefinite incarcerations and imprisonment without a trial while nationalism was still on the rise some worked within the boundaries of the law gandhi was known for his non-violent opposition the 1940s were hard for all of india as they were forced into world war ii but by 1947 under the indian national congress they achieved independence resulting in a violent partition of the country creating two new dominions the hindu majority india and muslim majority pakistan when the east india company was founded in 1600 britain was producing just 1.8 percent of the world's gdp while india was at 23 by the time the british left in the 1940s the colonisers increased their gdp almost tenfold while india was reduced to a third world country by 1950 india was a federal republic though losing its status as the world's largest economy india entered another economic boom during the 90s and is one of the fastest growing economies today india still has foreign problems with neighbouring china and pakistan and internally their rural areas are often living in poverty and with outbursts of violence resulting from the caste system as the country continues to innovate though more and more are moving into an urban middle class and higher standards of living almost everyone outside india has enjoyed a bollywood movie

Germany Austria-Hungary Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire also called the Central Powers fought against Great Britain France Russia Italy Romania Japan and the United States which are the Allied Powers thanks to new military Technologies and the horrors of trench warfare World War one saw unprecedented levels of Carnage and destruction it ended with the defeat of the Central Powers and the death of more than 16 million people throughout Europe and the world tensions had been growing throughout Europe following Germany's unification and annexation of French territories after the franco-prussian war of 1870. Germany's rise upset the European balance of powers and led to a game of alliances the spark was struck in Bosnia where the heir to the austro-hungarian Empire was killed by a Serbian nationalist struggling to end austro-hungarian rule over Bosnia Austria-Hungary supported by Germany blamed the Serbian government for the attack and declared war on Serbia which was backed by Russia Allied to France within a week World War One unfolded Germany's strategy known as the schlafen plan was for a war on two fronts against France and Russia the plan was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its Army in the west to defeat France first then shift forces to the east before Russia could fully mobilize in Asia Japan sided with Britain seizing German colonies in China and the Pacific the Ottoman Empire historic enemy of the Russian Empire entered the war on the side of Austria-Hungary and Germany opening fronts in the Middle East for controlling access to oil and the Suez Canal the German Advance penetrated deep into France closing in on Paris but was halted at the Battle of the Marin by franco-british forces the defeat meant the end of German plans for a quick victory in France both sides dug into trenches and the Western Front was the setting for a three years-long War of Attrition that saw the first use of chemical weapons and gases important World War One battles include Verda and the battle of the thumb on the Western Front and the huge naval battle of Jutland between the German and British fleets in 1916. the recent invention of Aviation was first used for observations then planes were gradually used for bombing and air combat around the world European colonies and British dominions such as India engaged in war from 1914 to 1916 Russia's Army mounted several offensives on the Eastern front but was unable to break through the German lines to support geographically isolated Russia Allied Forces tried to open a sea Supply Route via the Dardanelle Strait and then later launched a land invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula both campaigns failed against ottoman resistance Italy which was initially part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary had stayed neutral until 1915 as it turned against Austria-Hungary to Annex new territories the 12 Italian offensives along the sonso river yielded little result aspiring to recover Balkan territories Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in invading Serbia in the Seas the Royal Navy imposed the naval blockade on Germany while German submarines were used to sink Military and Commercial ships supplying the Allies including those coming from the U.S in addition Britain intercepted and transmitted the German telegram to Mexico offering an alliance against the United States which decided to go to war in 1917.

10,history,https://youtu.be/-GsolnXOiBg?si=ImDKVh-5tLYb-uaw,-GsolnXOiBg,"Hi everyone, welcome to 10 minute 
neuroscience. In this installment,   I’ll be talking about neurons, the fundamental 
units of the nervous system. I’ll cover their   basic structure and function and then I’ll 
talk about some ways we can categorize neurons. Neurons have some unique functions that form the 
basis for the powerful information processing   capabilities of the nervous system. They’re 
specialized for transmitting and receiving   information, and they can communicate with one 
another as well as with cells in other types of   tissues (like muscles or glands). They can also 
carry information (such as sensory information)   from the rest of the body to the brain. Something 
else worth noting about neurons is that there are   a lot of them. Current estimates suggest there's 
about 86 billion neurons in a typical human brain,   and those neurons create a very complex circuitry 
as each neuron forms many connections—usually   thousands of connections—with other neurons. 
This creates anywhere from hundreds of trillions   to maybe more than a quadrillion areas in a human 
brain where neurons communicate with one another. So if you look at a neuroscience textbook, 
you’ll see an image of a neuron that looks   something like this, and this is what we’ll 
use for our discussion of the neuron today.   But it’s important to note that neurons 
come in all shapes and sizes—there are   over 1000 different types—and most of them 
don’t look just like this one–so you can   see here some examples of different types of 
neurons found throughout the nervous system.   They look quite different, but they're all 
variations on a theme, and most of them have   the same general components—those general 
components are what we’ll focus on today. Before we get into those components let me just 
say something about how neurons communicate,   because it will make the anatomy we’ll talk about 
next easier to understand. I’ll have other videos   that cover these topics more in-depth but 
I’ll just provide a quick summary here.   Most neurons use electrical and chemical 
signals to send messages throughout the   brain. The main type of electrical signals are 
called action potentials; they’re created when   charged particles called ions flow into neurons 
and generate an electrical impulse that can travel   from one end of a neuron to another. These 
action potentials can cause the release of   chemical signals called neurotransmitters, 
and neurotransmitters can travel from one   neuron to the next neuron and either generate a 
response or inhibit a response in the next neuron.   By relying on these mechanisms, neurons 
can spread signals throughout the brain   in a fraction of a second. (I should point 
out that there are neurons that don’t use   neurotransmitters and rely solely on electrical 
signals to communicate with one another,   but we won’t focus on them here because they’re 
relatively rare in the adult nervous system.) OK, so let’s talk a bit about these different 
parts of a neuron. So first, on the right side   of this cell you can see a number of branch-like 
extensions jutting out from a circular structure   that otherwise resembles a typical cell. These 
extensions are called dendrites. The word dendrite   comes from a Greek word that means tree-like, and 
the name fits because dendrites bear a resemblance   to tree branches. Dendrites are the part of the 
neuron that typically receives messages from   other neurons. To accomplish this, on the surface 
of dendrites are proteins called receptors that   neurotransmitters can interact with. Because 
dendrites are typically where information   in a neuron is received, they can generally 
be thought of as an input area for the neuron. The part of the neuron that most resembles a 
typical cell is called the cell body or soma   (and soma is another Greek word that means body). 
The cell body is the metabolic center of the cell.   It contains the nucleus (which contains the DNA), 
it contains organelles that are involved in doing   things like making proteins, and it’s the site of 
the synthesis of various other neural components. Sticking out from one side of the 
cell body you can see this little   hill-like area, that’s called the axon hillock.   When information is received at the dendrites, 
it causes changes in the electrical properties   of the cell, and the axon hillock is a 
region where those changes are integrated   to determine if the incoming signals are 
strong enough for the neuron to initiate   its own action potential. This process of 
integrating signals is called summation. If a neuron fires an action potential, the impulse 
will travel down this structure called the axon   at very rapid speeds ranging from 1 to 100 m/s. 
So axons act to conduct action potentials. They   vary in size and can range from the order 
of micrometers, or millionths of a meter,   to up to about a meter in humans for the axons 
that run from the spinal cord to the foot.   Because there are so many neurons in the brain, 
by some estimates if you took all the neurons out   of the brain and laid them end to end, the axons 
would stretch over 100,000 miles—that’s enough   to wrap around the globe about 4 times. Axons 
are usually (although not always) covered in   a lipid-rich insulatory material called myelin 
(and that's what this purple striped structure   is representing here). Myelin helps to speed up 
the propagation of electrical signals down the   axon. It prevents the current from leaking out 
of the axon, but also it has these gaps in the   myelin called nodes of Ranvier---that's what 
this little area is here, a node of Ranvier.   And Ranvier is just the name of the 
scientist who discovered these).   At these gaps are channels that allow positively 
charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron. This   influx of positively-charged ions helps 
to regenerate the action potential and   move it down the axon (this is something else 
that I’ll talk about more in another video). At the end of the axon, you see that the structure 
branches out into endings we call axon terminals   or synaptic boutons.   The word bouton is French for button.   The axon terminals are often situated very close 
to the dendrites of another neuron (although they   can be situated next to any component of 
other neurons), and they communicate with   other neurons at specialized regions called 
synapses. So this right here is a synapse.   The neurons that communicate at a synapse don't 
typically come into contact with one another,   but the space separating them is very small: 
often only about 20-40 nanometers wide. I   know a nanometer is not something we can 
easily conceptualize, but for comparison,   a human hair is about 80,000-100,000 nanometers 
wide. So the space between neurons is very, very,   very tiny. That space is called a synaptic 
cleft. The neuron whose axon terminals end   at the synaptic cleft is called the presynaptic 
neuron (and that would be this black neuron here),   while the neuron on the other side of the synaptic 
cleft is called the postsynaptic neuron (that   would be this blue neuron here). When an action 
potential reaches the axon terminal it can cause   chemicals called neurotransmitters to be released 
into that synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters   can then bind or attach to receptors on the 
postsynaptic neuron, and either increase or   decrease the likelihood that the postsynaptic 
neuron will fire an action potential of its own. So those are the basic components of a neuron. 
Again most neurons have those defined regions but   they still often differ from one another in other 
substantial ways. We can use those differences to   group neurons into some broad categories. One way 
of categorizing neurons is based on the number of   processes that extend from the cell body. Using 
this method of classification, there are three   main groups of neurons: multipolar, bipolar, and 
unipolar. Multipolar neurons are the most common   type of neuron in the human nervous system and the 
nervous systems of other vertebrates. Multipolar   neurons usually have a single axon and many 
dendrites. They come in various shapes and sizes.   The length of their axons varies as does the 
extent of their dendritic branching, so they can   still look very different from one another, but 
all of them are modifications on a similar plan. Bipolar neurons have a cell body that gives 
rise to two extensions: one axon and one   dendritic structure. Sensory systems, like the 
visual system, rely heavily on bipolar neurons. Unipolar neurons have a single extension 
that has multiple branches, one of which   acts as the axon and others that form dendrites. 
Unipolar neurons are the simplest type of neuron,   and are common in invertebrate nervous systems but 
not very common in humans and other vertebrates. There are also variants of bipolar neurons 
called pseudo-unipolar neurons. These cells   initially form as bipolar neurons, but 
the dendrite and the axon fuse together   to form a single process that extends from 
part of the cell body. Pseudo-unipolar   neurons carry sensory signals, such as 
information about touch to the spinal cord. Neurons can also be classified based on 
function. Motor neurons, for example,   are responsible for controlling movement. So they 
have axons that form synapses with muscles to   cause those muscles to contract. Sensory neurons 
carry sensory signals back to the spinal cord   and brain. This would include information, 
for example, about touch, smell, vision,   etc. But the vast majority of neurons in the 
nervous system are considered interneurons,   which are neurons that receive information from 
neurons and then pass it on to other neurons. So   they act as the intermediaries for neurons. 
These interneurons are also often subdivided   into two types: projection or relay interneurons 
and local interneurons. Projection interneurons   typically have long axons that carry signals 
over long distances, such as from one part of   the brain to another. Local interneurons, on 
the other hand, form connections with other   neurons nearby. So, they have short axons 
and are involved in creating local circuits. So that is your basic summary 
of neurons. Thanks for watching! ",1657
11,medicine,https://youtu.be/5p9ucgRDie8?si=WWDSJM4Se8XUTg-q,5p9ucgRDie8,"Hi everyone, welcome to 10 minute neuroscience. In this installment, I’ll be discussing
depression. I’ll talk first about the serotonin hypothesis,
or the idea that low levels of serotonin might lead to depression, and I’ll explain why
this doesn’t seem to be the full story of what's going on in the brain in depression. Then I’ll cover several other hypotheses
about the neuroscience of depression that have gained traction over the years. Along the way, I’ll also very briefly cover
the mechanisms behind some of the most commonly used drugs to treat depression, like SSRIs. It’s important to mention from the start
that the neuroscience of depression is an area of active research, meaning we still
have a lot of questions that need to be answered. I won’t be able to cover all of the hypotheses
about the neuroscience of depression in 10 minutes, so by necessity I’ll be excluding
some important ideas, and I won’t be delving into specific genetic or environmental factors
at all—even though genetics, environment, and the interaction between the two is thought
to be a critical component of depression. Instead, I’ll be focusing primarily on hypotheses
about the specific neurological mechanisms that lead to changes in brain function that
are associated with depression. If we’re talking about the neuroscience
of depression, I think we need to start with the hypothesis that dominated the field for
decades, and is still influential today: the serotonin hypothesis. This hypothesis appeared after we discovered
the first true antidepressant drugs. Before these drugs, there were not many options
for drugs to specifically treat depression, and doctors sometimes used barbiturates, amphetamines,
and even opioids as treatment. This all changed with the discovery of the
first antidepressant, iproniazid. Iproniazid was intended to be an anti-tuberculosis
drug, but when it was tested on tuberculosis patients, it was noted that the drug had positive
effects on mood. This led to iproniazid becoming a popular
treatment for depression and an understanding of how iproniazid worked in the brain was
part of the basis for the serotonin hypothesis. Iproniazid acts to inhibit an enzyme called
monoamine oxidase, and it belongs to a class of drugs called monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
or MAOis. Monoamine oxidase is involved with the breakdown
of a group of neurotransmitters called the monoamines, which include serotonin. Thus, by inhibiting the breakdown of these
monoamine neurotransmitters, iproniazid leads to higher levels of them, and research suggested
the effects on serotonin might play an especially important role in the drug’s antidepressant
effects. Around the same time that iproniazid became
a popular treatment for depression, a type of drug known as a tricyclic antidepressant
was discovered to be effective in treating depression, and it was eventually learned
that these drugs worked by blocking the reabsorption, or reuptake, of neurotransmitters like serotonin
and norepinephrine. Reuptake is a process used by neurons to remove
excess neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft—the space between neurons that neurotransmitters
have to travel across to allow for communication between neurons to occur. By inhibiting this process of removing neurotransmitters,
it causes neurotransmitters to accumulate in the synaptic cleft, thereby raising neurotransmitter
levels and leaving more neurotransmitters available to interact with receptors. So tricyclic antidepressants seemed to be
working by increasing serotonin and norepinephrine levels, and again research eventually suggested
that the effects on serotonin might be especially important for the therapeutic action of the
drugs. So there was a consensus emerging based on
the mechanisms of these antidepressants (and other research that I’m not going into here)
that suggested depression might be caused by a deficiency of serotonin in the brain,
which is the main idea of the serotonin hypothesis. And this hypothesis was further bolstered
by the development of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These drugs were designed with the serotonin
hypothesis in mind. They specifically inhibit the reuptake of
serotonin—which is why they’re called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors—and
they raise serotonin levels as a result. The success of these drugs helped the serotonin
hypothesis to become the most widely accepted hypothesis for what causes depression. Over time, however, researchers began to identify
some flaws in the serotonin hypothesis. For example, studies have failed to consistently
find reduced serotonin activity in patients with depression. Other studies have attempted to reduce serotonin
levels by giving participants a diet deficient in tryptophan, an essential amino acid that’s
necessary for serotonin production; these studies have also not consistently found a
link between tryptophan depletion and depressed mood. Additionally, when someone takes a drug like
an SSRI, we think that serotonin levels go up quickly—probably within hours, but many
patients don’t begin to experience the full benefit of these drugs until they’ve been
taking them for weeks. This is important because if low serotonin
levels were the sole factor responsible for making people depressed, we might expect mood
to changes to occur along with changes in serotonin levels. And finally, we now have discovered other
drugs that don’t seem to have major effects on the serotonin system, but still are as
effective at treating depression as drugs that have a serotonin-based mechanism. These lines of evidence point to the idea
that serotonin is at best only part of the story when it comes to explaining the neuroscience
of depression. For the rest of this video, I’ll cover a
few other hypotheses that have emerged as potential explanations for brain mechanisms
underlying depression. One hypothesis about what might cause depression
involves dysregulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA axis. The HPA axis is a system that involves the
hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and adrenal glands—which are not shown here but are
endocrine glands that sit on top of the kidneys. Together these structures play an important
role in the stress response; their interaction is responsible for the secretion of the hormone
cortisol, which helps the body to make energy available during stressful situations. Some studies have found abnormalities in the
HPA axis that were linked to a hyperactive response to stress in depressed patients. For example, depressed patients are more likely
to have increased cortisol levels compared to non-depressed individuals. And there is also evidence that chronically
high cortisol levels might disrupt the activity of several brain regions, including the prefrontal
cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala, as well as functional circuits these brain regions
might be a part of.The prefrontal cortex plays an important role in a variety of cognitive
functions as well as emotional regulation, the hippocampus is critical for memory consolidation
and learning, and the amygdala is also involved in processing emotions. Thus, disruptions to the function of these
brain regions could impair one’s ability to think and reason clearly, regulate emotions,
and learn new ways to cope with challenges in life—all problems that might be linked
to depressive symptoms. Another hypothesis suggests a role for the
immune system in depression. This hypothesis is not mutually exclusive
from hypotheses that focus on the role of the HPA axis, because the immune system interacts
with the HPA axis and other nervous system structures, and thus immune dysfunction could
impact the function of the nervous system as well. A number of studies have linked depression
with immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation, which is a prolonged increase in immune activity
that can have negative effects on the body and/or the brain. Some have hypothesized that chronic inflammation
can cause changes in brain function, as well as changes in behavior that in some ways might mimic
what one might experience if they’re sick—fatigue, a negative mood, a desire to be isolated from
others, irritability, and so on. These, of course, are behaviors that also
resemble what people experience when they’re depressed. This hypothesis is supported by research that
has found that administering cytokines, which are signaling proteins involved in immune
responses including inflammation, can lead to symptoms of depression. Additionally, some studies have found that
cytokines are elevated in depressed patients. We don’t know, however, what might be the
cause of the immune dysfunction or inflammation in the first place—it could be stress, diet,
infection, or other factors or combinations of factors. It’s possible things like increased cortisol
levels or inflammation might lead to depression by disrupting brain function at a cellular
level, and specifically a couple functions that these changes might disrupt
are neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability
to create and eliminate synapses and flexibly alter neural connections, which makes the
brain capable of healthy learning, adaptation, and change. Neurogenesis is the production of new neurons. For much of the history of neuroscience, it
was believed that the neurons we’re born with and those that develop perinatally are
all we ever get, but in the late 1990s evidence started to emerge that suggested the hippocampus
was one of a couple regions in the brain that might continue to produce new neurons into
adulthood. As a side note, I should add that this is
a controversial area, with some evidence supporting the idea of adult neurogenesis in humans and
other evidence refuting it. Both neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are
thought to depend on a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which helps
regulate neuroplasticity and is especially important to the growth of new neurons as
well as the health and survival of neurons in general. Some studies have linked depression to low
levels of BDNF, and other studies have found antidepressants to increase BDNF levels. Still other studies have linked antidepressant
administration in lab animals with increased neurogenesis. So, one hypothesis is that antidepressants
might treat depression not simply by raising serotonin levels, but by causing downstream
effects that promote neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in areas like the hippocampus (which some
studies have found is actually reduced in size in depressed patients, a structural change
that could be the result of impaired neurogenesis, high cortisol levels, increased inflammation,
or something else altogether). So maybe it’s this neurogenesis and enhanced
neuroplasticity that helps depressed patients taking antidepressants to develop more cognitive
flexibility, leading to improvements in symptoms. It’s important to note that the evidence
to support this hypothesis comes mostly from animal studies, and it’s mixed—some studies
support it and some don’t. So it’s far from conclusive that this is
a mechanism in human depression. The difficulty in identifying a unified theory
of depression suggests that there may be multiple mechanisms at play in the disorder, and different
mechanisms may be responsible for depression in different people. Unfortunately, this doesn’t make depression
easy to understand or treat, and I think it’s safe to say at this time that we still have
a lot to learn about what’s going on in the brain to cause it. So it’s a complex, uncertain area, and while
there are many other hypotheses we could consider, I hope this video gave you a good introduction to
some of the most popular hypotheses about the neurological origins of depression. ",1809
12,medicine,https://youtu.be/1euK8OSIR9E?si=IxXBWfGp2blkAZ4T,1euK8OSIR9E,"Hi everyone, welcome to 10 minute neuroscience. In this installment, I’ll be talking about
synapses, the specialized areas where neurons communicate. I’ll cover the different components of a
synapse, how neurons communicate across synapses, and the differences between chemical and electrical
synapses. A synapse is a region where two neurons come
close enough to one another that they’re able to communicate. This capacity for neural communication is
one of the key things that gives the nervous system its diverse and impressive capabilities. It’s thought that most neurons have thousands
of synapses, and although estimates for the total number of synapses in the human brain
vary, they’re always extremely high—ranging from hundreds of trillions to over two quadrillion. Because each of these synapses represents
an area where neurons can talk to one another, synapses are the way that neurons in the brain
form circuits that enable them to work together to accomplish tasks ranging from simple movement
to complex cognition. In this video, I’ll talk about chemical
synapses and electrical synapses, but we’ll start with chemical synapses because they’re
much more common. Most neurons rely on both electrical and chemical
signaling to spread messages throughout the brain. Electrical signals are mostly used to send
messages from one end of a neuron to another; these are called action potentials. But once that action potential has reached
the end of a neuron and regions known as axon terminals or synaptic boutons, it usually
needs to prompt the release of a chemical signal to pass the message to the next neuron. Those chemical signals are called neurotransmitters,
and they’re released at chemical synapses. Most of the time a synapse is formed between
the axon terminals of one neuron and the dendrites of another. These are called axodendritic synapses. So that’s what we have right here, is an
axodendritic synapse, and this is a close-up of an axodendritic synapse. We’ll use an axodendritic synapse as an
example because they’re the most common type of synapse, but it’s important to note
that synapses can actually form between any two components of a neuron, such as between
the axon terminals and dendrites, axon terminals and cell bodies, axon terminals and axons,
or even dendrites and dendrites. So at an axodendritic synapse, the axon terminals
of one neuron are situated very close to the dendrites of another. They don’t actually come into contact with
one another, though. There’s a microscopic space separating them;
that space is known as the synaptic cleft. And so that’s what’s pictured here, a
synaptic cleft. A synaptic cleft is a very small space; it’s
usually somewhere around 20-40 nanometers wide. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, so
this size is not something that we can easily conceptualize. But a human hair is about 80,000-100,000 nanometers
wide and the head of a pin is about a million nanometers wide. So we’re talking about a very small space. The neuron that will be sending a signal across
the synaptic cleft is called the presynaptic neuron. The neuron that will be receiving the signal
is called the postsynaptic neuron. So what happens is we have this electrical
signal, this action potential, that’s traveling down the axon of the presynaptic neuron, and
when it reaches the axon terminal it causes changes in the electrical properties of the
interior of the cell, and that prompts a series of events that leads to the mobilization of
structures called synaptic vesicles. And so that’s what these large circular
structures represent here. Synaptic vesicles are tiny sac-like organelles
that contain neurotransmitter molecules, and that’s what the little red dots here represent,
neurotransmitter molecules. There are usually around 100-200 vesicles
in each axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron, and each vesicle typically contains thousands
of neurotransmitter molecules. These synaptic vesicles attach and fuse with
the cell membrane of the presynaptic neuron, and by doing so they release their neurotransmitters
into the synaptic cleft in a process called exocytosis. By the way, if you want to know more about
the sequence of events that leads to neurotransmitter release, you can watch my two minute video
on neurotransmitter release, which I’ll link up here. Once the neurotransmitter molecules enter
the synaptic cleft, they diffuse across the cleft and interact with proteins called receptors. So these receptors are typically found embedded
in the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron, and the neurotransmitter molecules can bind,
or attach, to these receptors, and when they do, they prompt changes in the postsynaptic
neuron that might make that neuron more or less likely to fire an action potential
of its own. After those neurotransmitters have interacted
with receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, their job of transmitting the message from
one neuron to the next is done. But once that job is complete, a next important
step is to remove the neurotransmitter molecules from the synaptic cleft. If this isn’t done, then the neurotransmitters
will continue to interact with receptors, and this continued interaction could impair
the ability of the synapse to remain functional. For example, when some receptors are overstimulated,
they can stop working for a period of time. This would prevent further signals from getting
through, and disrupt the functionality of the synapse, which in many cases needs to
be able to go through another round of neurotransmitter release and binding rapidly after the last
round. So, a critical aspect of synaptic transmission
is the removal of neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. Some of this happens through simple diffusion. In other words, some neurotransmitter molecules
will just float out of the synaptic cleft. This mechanism, however, only accounts for
a small percentage of neurotransmitter molecules, so it isn’t enough to terminate synaptic
transmission on its own. Another method of removing neurotransmitters
from the synaptic cleft is through the use of enzymes. So this structure right here is representing
an enzyme. So enzymes can inactivate and break down neurotransmitters,
a process known as enzymatic degradation. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine, for example,
is broken down by an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme breaks acetylcholine down into
its constituent parts, choline and acetate, and these products can be taken back up into
the presynaptic neuron and used to make more acetylcholine. A more common method of removing neurotransmitters
from the synaptic cleft, however, is a process called reuptake. In reuptake, a protein called a transport
protein, which typically sits embedded in the membrane of the presynaptic neuron, that
protein takes the excess neurotransmitter back up into the neuron that released it,
that’s why it’s called reuptake. And in many cases, these neurotransmitters
can be recycled and repackaged into vesicles to be released again. The process of reuptake is important to understand
because it’s a target for a number of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for
example, or SSRIs, are drugs that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, and they’re our
most common treatment for depression. By inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, this
makes serotonin more likely to accumulate in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing
serotonin levels. And for reasons that we don’t fully understand,
this increase in serotonin levels seems to be associated with an improvement of depressive
symptoms in some people. So I’ve described the primary activities
at a chemical synapse, and while most communication between neurons in the adult nervous system
involves neurotransmitters and chemical synapses, there are some synapses that use electrical
signaling as their primary mode of communication. And while these are relatively rare in the
adult human nervous system, they’re much more common in the embryonic human nervous
system and they’re common in invertebrate and non mammalian nervous systems. At an electrical synapse, neurons communicate
at a specialized region called a gap junction. So again, we have here a gap junction and
then a close-up of a gap junction over here. At electrical synapses, the space between
the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons is much smaller than in chemical synapses; it’s
only about 2-4 nanometers across. And the pre- and postsynaptic neurons are
actually connected by protein structures called gap junction channels.So these gap junction
channels create a pathway that connects the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and allows
electrical impulses in the form of charged particles called ions, which are represented
by these blue dots here, to flow from one neuron to the next. So this is basically an extension of the electrical
signaling that travels down the axon of the neuron, but it enables that message to pass
from the presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic neuron. While electrical synapses are not common in
humans, they do offer some benefits. Transmission at these synapses is very fast,
in fact it’s virtually instantaneous. While chemical synapses are fast as well,
they do involve a slight delay, and there’s essentially no delay at all at an electrical
synapse. Communication across electrical synapses can
also typically occur in both directions, meaning the presynaptic neuron can send signals to
the postsynaptic neuron and vice versa. This enables electrical synapses to be useful
in synchronizing electrical activity among groups of neurons. There are neurons, for example, in the brainstem
that are involved in regulating breathing and they use electrical synapses, which ensures
they’re working in a synchronized manner. One major benefit of chemical synapses, however,
is that they can amplify signals substantially. A relatively weak electrical current in the
presynaptic neuron can cause the release of thousands of neurotransmitter molecules at
a chemical synapse, and those neurotransmitter molecules can cause a substantial effect on
a postsynaptic neuron. So this is likely one reason for the prevalence
of chemical synapses in the human nervous system, although both types of synapses have
their place. And that’s a basic summary of synapses. Thanks for watching! ",1610

is characterized by symptoms that include impairments in social communication and interaction
and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although the neuroscience of autism is still
poorly understood, autism is considered to be a complex developmental disorder that involves
atypical brain organization starting early in development. Individuals with autism often experience a
period of unusually rapid brain growth in infancy and early childhood. This accelerated brain growth is linked to
an atypical pattern of connectivity between brain regions. A number of studies report that alterations
in brain circuitry involved with social interaction and attention can be detected well before
the symptoms of autism begin to appear. At this point, however, it’s unclear how
brain overgrowth and atypical connectivity might be linked to the occurrence of autism
symptoms. Research suggests that the risk of autism
is strongly influenced by genetics, yet studies consistently report that environmental factors
also play a large role. Although a number of potential environmental
factors have been identified, the risk factors for autism are far from definitive, and it
remains unclear which factors are responsible for causing an increase in autism risk, and
which are associated in a non-causal way. The risk factors that are most strongly linked
to autism are associated with the prenatal or perinatal period. Thus, it’s possible they might be responsible
for disruptions to typical neural development, leading to symptoms of autism months or years
later. How these risk factors might interfere with
neural development is still uncertain, but hypotheses have suggested potential mechanisms
such as epigenetic effects, inflammation, oxidative stress, or damage caused by oxygen
deficiency. More work needs to be done, however, to fully
elucidate the genetic and environmental risk factors for autism, as well as the mechanisms
for the development of autism symptoms. ",298

And the last one is homeostasis, which represents the ability of maintaining a certain equilibrium of physiological processes and living systems for an optimal function of organs and cellular processes this balance is maintained by many regulatory mechanisms, which perceive some perturbations from outside and react to them for example, mammals have the ability to regulate their core temperature in response to the low outside temperature in order to keep their organs working, and not freeze to borderline death, like how the majority of dumbass amphibians do for something to be classified as a living being it must be composed of cells, be able to maintain homeostasis undergo metabolism have a life cycle be able to grow adapt to the enviroment, and reproduce the stuff that is considered alive is classified in five kingdoms Bacteria, Protista, Fungi, plants, and animals there are more systems of classification, but this one is the most popular Bacteria are single-celled organisms with a simple internal structure that lack a nucleus and contain dna that just freely floats inside they were one of the first forms of life to appear on earth and thus evolved to live in water, soil, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste (accordingly shows a picture of YouTube trending), and inside other organisms and while some of them are helpful for digestion, certain species of bacteria are responsible for diseases like tuberculosis, or the bubonic plague their size typically varies between one and five micrometers in length however, there are a few species that are visible to the unaided eye, like the Thiomargarita namibiensis Which can reach up to a millimeter(?) in size the other types of organisms actually have a nucleus in which they responsibly store their dna, and are called Eukaryotes the most simple Eukaryotes are the Protists, which is actually a very wide term for every unicellular organisms that have a nucleus and cannot form many tissues The best they can do is to form colonies, and help each other survive like how the algae do eventually, some Protists to which were able to turn sunlight into energy evolved into plants multicellular organisms that are able to photosynthesize I'm, sure you've seen a plant at least once in your life.

16,medicine,https://youtu.be/ApvxVtBJxd0?si=VcX6KbXsCJvfFiE2,ApvxVtBJxd0,oh hello I'm so glad you're here I'm just finishing up grading some papers um and the papers I'm grading today are on differences between viruses and bacteria and I have to tell you they didn't do so well I want to teach you the differences between viruses bacteria so maybe you can come and teach my students viruses and bacteria are what we would describe as germs and these are the germs that we think about when we think about getting sick and people often confused between bacteria and viruses but they're actually very different than each other they do have some similarities so let's think about the similarities first they're both microscopic meaning very very small so we need a microscope to see them um they both do cause and can cause very severe um illness they can cause illness in humans like us they can cause illness in animals like this little dog here and even plants have bacterial and viral illnesses that can be problems for them um there're going to be different types of viruses and bacteria that infect the different species but they all can cause a lot of trouble let's think about some ways that they're different than each other so I said that they're both microscopic that's true but they actually are very different size-wise so bacterial cells are actually very large compared to viruses bacterial cells can be sometimes 200 times larger than viruses which is really interesting but again still both microscopic bacterial cells are very unique in that they are alive they're individual cells they're able to reproduce on their own so if we call our little &em yay candy a a excuse me a bacterial cell this bacterial cell can reproduce take one and then you make two out of that these two would then go on to make four and they're going to continue to reproduce in this way so they can reproduce on their own um and then they can cause infections in people bacterial cells are interesting too because they actually can be good for us we have bacterial cells that live all over our bodies on our skin there's bacterial cells that live in our intestines they're called normal flora and they're actually really important they help us to break down food and any even produce vitamins like vitamin K for us so they can be good too so these are bacterial cells so they are able to reproduce on their own versus viruses viruses are not actually living it's interesting that scientists classify them as something between living and non-living which is a really interesting place to be but these viruses the reason we say that they're in between living and non-living is that they need a host to reproduce so viruses they can live on door handles and they can live on hands again if you shake hands with somebody you can pass a virus to somebody you sneeze and cough um but once they pass from one person to another they actually have to get into a cell to reproduce and make more of them so here's an example of this so This say this is your cell right you uh shook hands with somebody you touched your eye and now you have a virus that's invading your cells here's your little virus that's going to infect our cell so what the virus is actually going to do is attach two particular cells it's going to take this DNA that's inside the virus run that down into your cell and then what the viral viral DNA will do is take over the manufacturing equipment inside of the cell so inside the cell no more are we producing bacterial cells or any type of your own proteins but now we're making only viruses so it's essentially a virus Factory at this point so it's no longer performing functions for you then what happens is this thing is going to fill up with viruses so much so baby viral particles are going to fill fill fill until we get to the point when bust open and now we have of these little baby viruses running around and they're going to go and infect another cell in your body so that's how viral infections spread in your body so viruses need a host cell to reproduce that's a major difference that we have how do we treat viruses and how do we treat um bacterial cells viruses um typically are shorter course of illness you're talking between two and 10 days depending upon how healthy the person was to start with bacterial illnesses typically typically are longer you're looking at more more of a 10day to 12-day course for bacterial infections um and then how do we treat them viruses can be treated only with antivirals so you can get those from the doctor but in general the best way to treat a virus is rest and um soup and water and that's essentially it so viruses will be taken care of by your immune system if you rest and baby yourself for a little while versus bacterial infections bacterial infections are treated by antibiotics so antibiotics are actually really important in getting into and busting open those bacterial cells traditionally most colds and most most things that are making you feel bad are viruses so some common examples of viruses would be the Rhino virus which is the common cold um that's the upper respiratory infection that most people get um you have influenza which is a different type of virus um that causes more severe uh fever um body aches it's more um all over that you feel that and then bacterial infections you're looking at things like there's a particular type of uh bacteria that causes ulcers um heloa pylori can cause ulcers um things that cause food poisoning leria manella eoli can cause food poisoning those are bacterial infections so when you go to the doctor it's important that you understand that there are particular tests that can be done to determine do you have a bacterial infection or do you have a viral infection and the viral infections can only be treated with rest and hydration antivirals if necessary but bacterial infections are the ones that require those antibiotics so those are some major differences right we said that they're both microscopic they both can cause human illness um so we need to have good handwashing good hygiene to make sure that we don't pass those around um but again major differences we're talking size-wise bacteria are very large compared to viruses which are very small and the types of infections that they actually create are going to be very different as well so hopefully you can use that information in your life and hopefully come and teach my students some stuff too ,1154

18,medicine,https://youtu.be/HobxLbPhrMc?si=nToJnqgj3Ih3A6xG,HobxLbPhrMc,"If you've had surgery, you might remember starting to count
backwards from ten, nine, eight, and then waking up with the surgery
already over before you even got to five. And it might seem like you were asleep,
but you weren't. You were under anesthesia, which is much more complicated. You were unconscious, but you also couldn't move, form memories, or, hopefully, feel pain. Without being able to block all those
processes at once, many surgeries would be 
way too traumatic to perform. Ancient medical texts from Egypt,
Asia and the Middle East all describe early anesthetics containing things like opium poppy, mandrake fruit, and alcohol. Today, anesthesiologists often combine regional, inhalational 
and intravenous agents to get the right balance for a surgery. Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals
from a specific part of the body from getting to the brain. Pain and other messages travel through
the nervous system as electrical impulses. Regional anesthetics work by setting up
an electrical barricade. They bind to the proteins 
in neurons' cell membranes that let charged particles in and out, and lock out positively charged particles. One compound that does this is cocaine, whose painkilling effects 
were discovered by accident when an ophthalmology intern
got some on his tongue. It's still occasionally used 
as an anesthetic, but many of the more common
regional anesthetics have a similar chemical structure
and work the same way. But for major surgeries where you need
to be unconscious, you'll want something that acts
on the entire nervous system, including the brain. That's what inhalational anesthetics do. In Western medicine, diethyl ether
was the first common one. It was best known as a recreational drug until doctors started to realize that
people sometimes didn't notice injuries they received 
under the influence. In the 1840s, they started sedating
patients with ether during dental extractions and surgeries. Nitrous oxide became popular
in the decades that followed and is still used today. although ether derivatives, 
like sevoflurane, are more common. Inhalational anesthesia is usually 
supplemented with intravenous anesthesia, which was developed in the 1870s. Common intravenous agents include
sedatives, like propofol, which induce unconsciousness, and opioids, like fentanyl, 
which reduce pain. These general anesthetics 
also seem to work by affecting electrical signals
in the nervous system. Normally, the brain's electrical signals
are a chaotic chorus as different parts of the brain
communicate with each other. That connectivity keeps you awake
and aware. But as someone becomes anesthetized, those signals become calmer
and more organized, suggesting that different 
parts of the brain aren't talking to each other anymore. There's a lot we still don't know
about exactly how this happens. Several common anesthetics bind to
the GABA-A receptor in the brain's neurons. They hold the gateway open, letting negatively charged particles
flow into the cell. Negative charge builds up
and acts like a log jam, keeping the neuron from transmitting
electrical signals. The nervous system has lots
of these gated channels, controlling pathways for movement, memory, and consciousness. Most anesthetics probably 
act on more than one, and they don't act on 
just the nervous system. Many anesthetics also affect the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. Just like early anesthetics, which included familiar poisons like
hemlock and aconite, modern drugs can 
have serious side effects. So an anesthesiologist has to mix
just the right balance of drugs to create all the features of anesthesia, while carefully monitoring
the patient's vital signs, and adjusting the drug mixture as needed. Anesthesia is complicated, but figuring out how to use it allowed for the development 
of new and better surgical techniques. Surgeons could learn how to routinely
and safely perform C-sections, reopen blocked arteries, replace damaged livers and kidneys, and many other life-saving operations. And each year, new anesthesia techniques
are developed that will ensure more and more patients
survive the trauma of surgery. ",639
19,medicine,https://youtu.be/B_tTymvDWXk?si=EKHVXW-3GruaUb2a,B_tTymvDWXk,in this video we're going to take an overview of the digestive system we'll take a look at what it does how it works and the different organs they need to know about then in the next video we'll take a closer look at the enzymes that we use in the process in order to function properly humans have to eat loads of food which is mostly used for energy so that we can move about and keep our metabolism running the three main groups of nutrients that we need are carbohydrates like starch and glucose proteins and fats unfortunately though these are locked up inside large molecules which themselves are inside big pieces of food the role of digestion therefore is to break all this food down into tiny pieces so that we can absorb it into our body cells this process relies on both physical breakdown and chemical breakdown by enzymes as we'll see let's start at the top once you place some food in your mouth you break it down physically by chewing you also release saliva from your salivary glands which helps make the mixture more liquid and also contains salivary amylase which is an enzyme that helps break down carbohydrates next you swallow the food so that they can pass down your gullet which is also known as your esophagus and almost straight away it passes through to your stomach now the stomach is basically a muscular sac and it has three important things that you need to know about one it contracts its muscular walls to push the food around and mix it two it produces pepsin which is a protease enzyme that breaks down proteins and three it produces hydrochloric acid which kills bacteria and also provides the right environment for the pepsin enzyme to work after an hour or so in the stomach the food is squeezed out into the small intestine the small intestine is where the digested food will be absorbed into the bloodstream but it's also the place where most of the digestion will take place and produces digestive enzymes itself to help digestion that said it's actually an organ called the pancreas that makes most of the digestive enzymes and it pushes them into the small intestine in the form of pancreatic juices another organ that secretes things into the small intestine is the gallbladder but at this time it's releasing bile rather than digestive enzymes this bile has two main rules one is that it neutralizes the acid from the stomach making the ph more ideal for the digestive enzymes to function and it can do this because the bile itself is alkaline its other role is emulsifying fats which basically means that it helps break big blobs of fat into tiny droplets and this helps because it gives the fat a much bigger surface area for the digestive enzymes to work on now one thing we need to point out is that the bile isn't made in the gallbladder it's actually made in the liver it's just stored in the gallbladder until it's released into the small intestine getting back to our intestine once the food has been digested into lots of tiny pieces it can be absorbed across the lining of the intestine straight into the bloodstream and it's worth taking a closer look at how this works because the lining of the intestine is an example of an exchange surface and you need to be able to describe how it's adapted to its function if we take a closer look at the inside lining of the small intestine we see that there are loads of these little finger-like projections which are called villi these massively increase the surface area of the small intestine which means that digested food can be absorbed into the bloodstream much more quickly two other adaptations to notice are that the villi only have a single layer of surface cells which means that the nutrients only have to diffuse a very short distance and that they have a very good blood supply which maintains the concentration gradient okay so let's imagine that all the useful nutrients have been absorbed into the bloodstream at this point there's still a lot of material left in the small intestine this is because lots of the food that we eat isn't actually digestible and because of all the secretions for example from the pancreas stomach and gallbladder the leftover material is going to be really watery so next it passes into the large intestine which absorbs all of this excess water leaving behind feces that are stored in the rectum until they're removed we've now covered every part of the process in detail but before we finish let's just quickly recap the order everything happens in so that you can clearly see the whole process from start to finish first we take some food and put it in our mouth where we chew it and the slider glands add saliva it then goes down the gullet or esophagus and passes into our stomach once the stomach has done its thing it's pushed out into the small intestine where it mixes with pancreatic juices from the pancreas and also bile that was stored in the gallbladder but remember made in the liver while the food is in the small intestine it's continually broken down and digested and once small enough to be absorbed from the small intestine into the bloodstream once everything that can be absorbed has been absorbed the leftover material will move into the large intestine where all of the water is absorbed back into the body leaving behind feces in the rectum and that's everything for today if you found this video useful then please do give us a like and subscribe and hopefully we'll see you next time ,977

microscopic symbols on them that can't be seen with a naked eye when lightning passes through them they can speak the incomprehensible language of binary highly trained Wizards called software Engineers can learn this language to build powerful machines that create Illusions these Illusions can then control the way people think and act in the real world in today's illusion I will harness this magic to pull back the veil on the almighty computer by looking at four different ways computers actually compute things at the hardware level because to put a computer needs a pu like a CPU GPU TPU or dpu the last 100 years have been crazy the first truly programmable computer was the Z1 which was created by Conrad Zeus in 1936 in his mom's basement but then it got blown up in 1943 during the bombardment of Berlin its entire highly mechanical with over twenty thousand Parts it represents binary data with sliding metal sheets it could do things like Boolean algebra and floating Point numbers and had a clock rate of 1 Hertz which means it could execute one instruction per second to put that in perspective modern CPUs are measured in gigahertz or billions of cycles per second over the next 10 years people thought really hard about how computers should actually work and in 1945 we got the Von Neumann architecture which is still used in modern ships today it's the foundational design that describes how data and instructions are stored in the same memory space then handled by a processing unit a couple years later there is a huge breakthrough with the invention of the transistor which is a semiconductor that can amplify or switch electrical signals like a transistor could represent a one if current passes through it or a zero if current doesn't pass through it this was a hugely forward then in 1958 the integrated circuit was developed allowing multiple transistors to be placed on a single silicon chip then finally in 1971 Intel released the first commercially available microprocessor that had all the features you know and love from a modern CPU it was a 4-bit processor meaning it could handle four bits of data at a time with approximately 2300 transistors the clock speed was 740 kilohertz which was extremely fast at the time CPUs are pretty complicated and if you really want to learn how they work I'd highly recommend reading cpu.land which does an amazing job of breaking down how they actually execute programs it's totally free and was written by high schoolers Lexi Matic and hack Club but what I want to focus on is what they're actually used for so we can compare them to the other pus like its name implies the central processing unit is like the brain of a computer it runs the operating system executes programs and manages Hardware it has access to the system's RAM and includes a hierarchy of caches on the chip itself for faster data retrieval a CPUs optimize for sequential computations that require extensive branching and logic like imagine some navigation software that needs to run an algorithm to compute the shortest possible route between two points the algorithm may have a lot of conditional logic like if else statements that can only be computed one by one or sequentially acpu is optimized for this type of work now modern CPUs also have multiple cores which allows them to do work in parallel which allows you to use multiple applications on your PC at the same time and programmers can write code that does multi-threading to utilize the cores on your machine to run code in parallel check out this video on my second Channel if you want to learn how to do that in JavaScript now to make a computer faster one might think we could just add more and more CPU cores the reality though is that CPU cores are expensive as the cores scale up so does power consumption and the heat dissipation requirements it becomes a matter of diminishing returns and the extra complexity is just not worth it at the time of this video 24 cores is typically the upper limit of higher end ships like Apple's M2 Ultra and Intel's I9 but there are massive chips like the 128 core AMD epic designed for data centers now when it comes to CPUs there are multiple different architectures out there and that's a big deal if you're doing low-level systems programming but every developer should be familiar with arm and x86 64-bit x86 is what you'll find on most modern desktop computers while arm is what you'll find on mobile devices because it has a more simplified instruction set and better power efficiency which means better battery life however this distinction has been changing over the last few years thanks to the Apple silicon chips which have proven that the arm architecture can also work for high performance Computing on laptops and desktops and even Microsoft is investing in running windows with arm in addition arm is becoming more and more popular with Cloud providers like the neoverse chip or Amazon's graviton 3 which allows the cloud to compute more stuff with less power consumption which is one of the biggest expenses in a data center but at some point we've all hit the limitations of a CPU like when I try to run pirated Nintendo 64 games on my Raspberry Pi it lags like crazy that's because a lot of computation is required to calculate the appearance of all the lights and shadows in a game on demand well that's where the GPU comes in a graphics Processing Unit or graphics card is highly optimized for parallel Computing unlike a CPU with a measly 16 cores nvidia's RTX 4080 has nearly 10 000 cores each one of these cores can handle a floating points or integer computation per cycle and that allows games to to perform tons of linear algebra in parallel to render Graphics instantly every time you push a button on your controller gpus are also essential for training deep learning models that perform tons of matrix multiplication on large data sets this has led to massive demand in the GPU market and nvidia's stock price recently landed on the moon so he says okay give me 200 I gave him 200 and for 200 I bought 15 I think it was 20 of Nvidia if gpus have so many cores why not just use a GPU over a CPU for everything the short answer is that not all cores are created equal a single CPU core is far faster than a single GPU core and its architecture can handle complex logic and branching whereas a GPU is only designed for simple computations most of the code out in the world can take advantage of parallel Computing and needs to run sequentially with a single thread a CPU is like a Toyota Camry it's extremely versatile but can't take you to the Moon a GPU is more like a rocket ship it's really fast when you want to go in a straight line but not really ideal if we're going to pick up your groceries as the name lies gpus were originally designed for graphics but nowadays everybody wants them to train an AI that can overthrow the government but there's actually Hardware designed for that use case called the TPU or tensor Processing Unit these chips are very similar to gpus but designed specifically for tensor operations like the matrix multiplication required for deep learning they were developed by Google in 2016 to integrate directly with its tensorflow software a TPU contains thousands of these things called multiply accumulators it allows the hardware to perform matrix multiplication without the need to access registers or shared memory like a GPU would and if you have a neural network that's going to take weeks or months to train atpu could save you millions of dollars that's pretty cool but that brings us to the newest type of pu the dpu or data processing unit the CEO of Nvidia described it as the third major pillar of computing going forward but you'll likely never use one in your own computer because they're designed specifically for Big Data Centers they're most like a CPU and typically based on the arm architecture but are highly optimized for moving data around they handle networking functions like packet processing routing and security and also deal with data storage like compression and encryption the main goal is to relieve the CPU from any data processing jobs so it can focus on living its best life by doing general purpose Computing and with that we've looked at four different ways a computer computes but there's one more wild card that we might get to experience in our lifetime and that's the qpu or Quantum Processing Unit all the chips we've looked at so far deal in bits ones and zeros but quantum computers deal in qubits or Quantum bits that can exist in a superposition of both States simultaneously now a Cuba can represent multiple possibilities at once but when measured it collapses into one of the possible States based on probability these qubits are subject to quantum entanglement which means the state of one is directly related to another no matter the distance between them these properties are used together to create Quantum Gates which are like logic gates and regular computers but work in entirely different ways that I'm too stupid to understand what I do understand is that if this technology ever gets good it will completely change the world current cryptographic systems like RSA are underpinned by the fact that classical algorithms used for factorization would take billions of years to crack with Brute Force even with the best computers of today but quantum computers will be able to run different algorithms like Shore's algorithm that's exponentially faster at factorization and thus poses a major threat to Modern encryption and security luckily there's no quantum computer today that can run this algorithm and even if there were they sure as hell wouldn't be telling you and me about it ,1763

talk about the different network types. And these   network types depend on how large they are and 
how much of an area they cover geographically..   Now most people who have a basic knowledge of 
networking are familiar with terms such as LAN   and WAN. But in addition to those there are a few 
more network types that a lot of people are not   familiar with. So that's what we're going to talk 
about in this video. So let's first talk about a   PAN. PAN stands for personal area network. 
Now this is a type of network that is used   on a personal level. It's a small network that is 
used for connecting devices such as smartphones,   tablets, and laptops. And they connect to 
each other by using wireless technologies   such as bluetooth, infrared, and near 
field communication or NFC. But they   can also connect by using a wired connection 
such as a USB cable. PANs are generally used   for transferring small files such as music, 
photos, calendar appointments, and so on. And the next type of network is a LAN . Now 
LAN stands for local area network. A local area   network is a group of devices such as computers, 
servers, switches, and printers which are located   in the same building, such as in an office or in 
a home. In other words, in close proximity to each   other. The most common type of LAN is an Ethernet 
LAN, where two or more computers are connected to   Ethernet cables using a switch. Now a WLAN or 
wireless local area network is a local area   network that uses wireless communication instead 
of wired communication. A wireless LAN is defined   as having at least two devices that use wireless 
communication to form a local area network. A   wireless LAN will typically have a Wi-Fi router 
or a wireless access point for wireless devices   such as laptops, tablets, wireless desktops, and 
smartphones, to communicate. So in simple terms,   a wireless LAN is a LAN but without using 
cables. And the next network type is a CAN.  Now CAN stands for campus area network. A CAN is 
a network that joins two or more LANs together   within a limited area. So for example a CAN could 
be a university that has multiple buildings in   the same general area that are connected to each 
other to form a larger network. So these buildings   could be different departments on a University's 
property with each building having their own LAN   in their department. And then the buildings 
are connected to form a campus area network.   And the next network type is a MAN. MAN stands 
for metropolitan area network. Now this is a   larger network than a CAN.  It's a network that 
spans over several buildings in a city or   town. MANs are typically connected using a high 
speed connection such as fiber optic cable. It's   a high speed network that gives the ability 
for sharing data and resources within a city.   And the next one is a SAN or storage area 
network. Now a SAN is a special high speed   network that stores and provides access to 
large amounts of data. Basically what a SAN is,   is that it's a dedicated network that's used for 
data storage. This network consists of multiple   disk arrays, switches, and servers. One of 
the main reasons for using a SAN is because   SANs are not affected by network traffic 
such as bottlenecks that can happen in   a local area network. And that's because SANs 
aren't really a part of a local area network,   it's partitioned off. It's a network all by 
itself. And then finally there's the wide   area network or WAN. A WAN is the largest type 
of network.  A WAN includes multiple LANs, CANs,   and MANs. It's a network that spans over a large 
geographical area such as a country continent   or even the entire globe. A good example 
of a wide area network is the internet. ",667

Or maybe your existing router has both of them And did you ever wonder why some routers have these dual bands? So that's what we're going to talk about in this video Now a frequency band is how wireless data is transmitted between devices These bands are radio waves that carry the data and these bands are either 2.4 gigahertz or 5 gigahertz Now a lot of Wi-Fi routers will only transmit one of these bands, which would be the 2.4 band and that's because it's the most common frequency and these are called single band routers But a lot of newer Wi-Fi routers will transmit both the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz bands And these are called dual band Wi-Fi routers  Now, the 2.4 band works pretty well It's the standard band But the problem is that it's not just a standard band that's used in Wi-Fi routers It's also the standard band that's used in a lot of other devices, things like microwave ovens, cordless phones, bluetooth devices, and wireless cameras, all used a 2.4 gigahertz band  and his became a problem because the fact that so many other devices use the 2.4 band, the signal became overcrowded and was causing a lot of interference with Wi-Fi signals and when this happens it slows down the Wi-Fi network speed and Sometimes could cause you to lose connection to the Wi-Fi router So that is why the 5 gigahertz band was added the 5 gigahertz band is a newer band And so it's not as commonly used as the 2.4, so it's used by fewer devices And because it's used by fewer devices, the 5 gigahertz is not as crowded So there is no interference or minimal interference So using the 5 gigahertz would relieve the problem related to slow network speeds and connection drops that will be caused by interference from other devices Another reason why the 2.4 is more vulnerable to interference is because of the difference in wireless channels Now if you're not familiar with what a wireless channel is, a wireless channel is just a way to fine-tune and alter a frequency Sometimes you might need to change to a different channel If you are experiencing interference from different wireless devices and changing to a different channel will give you that ability The 2.4 gigahertz band has 11 channels to choose from but of these 11 channels Only 3 are non-overlapping So basically you have three solid channels to choose from.  But the 5 gigahertz has more channels.  It has 25 non-overlapping channels And some other differences between a 2.4 and 5 gigahertz band is the speed and the range that they cover.  The 2.4 gigahertz band Transmits data at a slower speed than the 5 gigahertz But it does have a longer range than the 5 gigahertz.  The 5 gigahertz band transmits data at a faster speed Than a 2.4 but it has a shorter range.  The 5 gigahertz has a shorter range Because it has a higher frequency and higher frequencies have a harder time penetrating solid objects, such as floors and walls in a building So as you can see on this illustration this dual band Wi-Fi router is broadcasting a 2.4 gigahertz band Which is the green color and it's also broadcasting a 5 gigahertz band, which is the red color so as you can see the 2.4 band has a longer range and the signal can cover most of this building and It can also penetrate the second floor and the walls But the 5 gigahertz band has a shorter range The signal doesn't penetrate the second floor or the walls which limits its range inside a building So the question is, which band do you want to actually use?   And that really depends on your situation. they both have their advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage of a 2.4 gigahertz is that it has a further range and it can penetrate solid objects better however the disadvantage that it has is that it's more vulnerable to interference because so many other devices use the same band and it's also slower than the 5 gigahertz  And the advantage of the 5 gigahertz is that it has a higher transfer speed and it's less vulnerable to interference But at the same time it does have a shorter range and it has a harder time penetrating through solid objects.  And if you're interested in getting a dual band Wi-Fi router I'll put a link in the description of this video below of a dual band Wi-Fi router that I personally recommend And thank you for watching ",797
23,comp_sci,https://youtu.be/J_bf_KE5llQ?si=iAEgU7_vs3blf0sE,J_bf_KE5llQ,"Hello everyone. In this lesson we're going to talk about the
difference between bluetooth and wifi. Now both of these are radio frequency technologies
that are used for wirelessly connecting electronic devices. And certain devices will have both bluetooth
and wifi functionality built into them. Now both of these do have certain things
in common, but there are also some differences. So let s first talk about bluetooth. Now bluetooth was created to get rid of the
hassle of dealing with wires and cables. Bluetooth is a low-power, wireless technology
that uses a short-range radio that provides a way to connect nearby devices to each other. Bluetooth devices will have a computer chip
inside of them that will broadcast a signal so that other bluetooth devices can connect
to them, which is known as pairing. And when the devices are paired, they will then
be able to exchange information between them. Now the most common use for bluetooth is for wireless audio streaming.  Such as pairing your cell phone to wireless earbuds, or an external
speaker. It can also be used for pairing headphones
to a TV or pairing a wireless keyboard and mouse to a tablet or computer. But one of the most common uses is pairing
your cell phone to your car's audio system. Which enables hands-free use when you're on the
phone while driving. The range of bluetooth is approximately 30
feet or 10 meters. Now let s talk about wifi. Now wifi is a wireless technology that uses
radio waves that allows devices such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and cell phones
to be able to connect wirelessly to the internet. And the most common way that wifi devices access
the internet is by connecting to a wifi router. Wifi routers will have a connection to an
internet service provider that will broadcast a wifi signal so that nearby devices can connect
to the signal and grant them internet access. And in addition to internet access, these devices
can be configured to exchange information between them by creating a network. And depending upon the surrounding environment, wifi has a range anywhere from 100 - 300 feet. So what are the differences between bluetooth
and wifi? Well, the main difference is that bluetooth
is for connecting devices to each other to exchange data. And wifi is used to connect devices to the
internet. And another difference is the range and speed. Bluetooth has a slower transfer rate and a
shorter range and the reason for this, is power. Bluetooth uses less power than wifi.  So even
though it sacrifices in range and speed, it also has
an advantage with longer battery life with less frequent
charging which allows bluetooth devices to be manufactured
in a smaller size that doesn't require large batteries. But wifi on the other hand, is faster than bluetooth and has an approximate 10x longer range. Now both bluetooth and wifi operate at 2.4 GHz.   But the thing is, a lot of other devices also operate at 2.4 GHz, such as
microwaves and cordless phones and this could interfere with wireless signals. But bluetooth is less vulnerable to interference
because it uses a technology called Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, which uses a method
of transmitting signals in a pattern that only the
transmitting and receiving devices know. The signal hops between 79 different channels
and changes channels 1,600 times per second. Which makes bluetooth highly resistant to
interference when compared to wifi. And bluetooth devices are also simpler to connect
to because there's no password required. So for example, let's say you wanted to pair
bluetooth earbuds to your cell phone. You would just power on the earbuds
and then turn on bluetooth on your cell phone. Then in your device settings on your phone, you just click on earbuds when they appear and then you're connected. So thank you everyone for watching this video on the difference between bluetooth and wifi.  Please subscribe and I will see you in the next video. ",669

ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. And in this video, we will see the difference
between the Microprocessor and the Microcontroller. So, visually if you see any microcontroller
or microprocessor, there is hardly any difference between them. They almost look very identical. But they are different in many aspects. They are different in terms of the applications
in which they are used, They are different in terms of the cost. They are different in terms of the processing
power which they possess. And they are different in terms of the power
consumption. So, today we will see the difference between
the microprocessor and the microcontroller based on all these aspects. So, first let's see the difference between
them in terms of the applications in which they are used. So, the classic example of the microprocessor
application is personal computer or laptop. So, using this laptop we can do a lot of stuff. Like, we can use it for the gaming, for web
browsing, for photo editing, for creating documents,
or we can use if for mathematical calculations, simulations or media streaming. So, the microprocessor is basically used in
an application where the task in not predefined. It depends on the user. Or it is used in applications where intensive
processing is required. While in a case of a microcontroller, they
are used for specific task. So, based on the inputs which are given to
the microcontroller, it does some processing and it gives the result as an output. So, here the input could be a user input or
the inputs which are coming from the sensors. So, the example of microcontroller applications
is the digital camera, washing machine, and microwave oven. So, if you see all these devices, the task
which is going to be performed is predefined. Like, in the case of a microwave oven, once
you set the power and the timing, it gives you the cooked food. Likewise in the case of a washing machine,
once you set the parameters of the machine, it gives you the clean and dry clothes. So, basically, a microcontroller is used in
applications where the task is predefined. Now, let's see the difference between them
in terms of the internal structure. So, like I said earlier, the microprocessors
are used in applications where the task is not predefined. So, they can be used for a very light application
like creating documents or a very intensive application like gaming or media streaming. So, the amount of memory that is required
depend upon the application. So, if you see the microprocessor chip, it
only contains CPU. which is Central Processing Unit. And all the memory elements and the I/O interfaces
are connected to it externally. So, in a case of a microprocessor, memory
elements like RAM, ROM, I/O ports, Serial interfaces and timers, all are connected externally. While in a case of a microcontroller, as they
are used for a specific task, the amount of memory and the I/O ports which are required
are limited. So, in a case of a microcontroller, all the
memory elements and I/O ports are integrated along with the CPU inside a single chip. So, the size of an overall system is much
smaller. While in a case of a microprocessor, as all
the memory elements and I/O ports are connected externally, so overall size of the system
is larger than the microcontroller. Now, let's see the difference between microcontroller
and microprocessor in terms of the processing power and memory. So, microprocessors are operated at much higher
speed. So, if you see the clock speed of a microprocessor,
it is in the range of Giga Hertz. The clock speed varies from the 1 GHz to the
4 GHz for the high-end processors. So as microprocessor has to run an operating
system, the amount of memory that is RAM and ROM, which is required is quite high. So, if you see the Random Access Memory or
RAM which is a volatile memory in the microprocessor, it ranges from 512 MB and it goes up to 32GB
for high-end microprocessors. Similarly, if you see the ROM in the microprocessor,
it ranges from the 128 GB and it goes up to the 2TB. That is 2 Tera Bytes. And the common peripheral interfaces which
you see in the microprocessors are like USB, High-speed Ethernet, and the UART. While in a case of a microcontroller, the
clock speed is in the range of Mega Hertz. So, if you see the clock speed of microcontrollers,
it ranges from the 1 MHz and it goes up to the 300 MHz in the high-end microcontrollers. And as these microcontrollers are defined
for a specific task, the amount of memory that is required by them is quite less. So, if you see a Random Access Memory or RAM
inside the microcontroller, it is in the range of Kilo Bytes. So, it can go from the 2 KB up to the 256
KB. Similarly, if you see a flash memory or a
programme memory inside the microcontroller, it varies from the 32 KB and it can go up
to the 2 MB. And the common peripheral interfaces which
you find inside the microcontroller are I2C, SPI, and UART. So, basically all these are serial interfaces,
which you find in a modern day microcontrollers. So, if you see a modern day microprocessors,
they are either 32 bit or 64 bit. So 32-bit microprocessor means, a microprocessor
can handle 32 bits of binary data at the same time. Similarly, a 64-bit microprocessor can handle
64 bits of data at the same time. So, in a case of 64 bit of microprocessor,
all the address bus and the data buses are of the 64 bits. Similarly, in the case of a 32-bit microprocessor,
the address and the data bus are of 32 bits. While if you see modern day microcontrollers,
they are either of 8 bits, 16 bits or 32 bits. So, the amount of data which can be handled
by a microprocessor in a single cycle is higher than the microcontrollers. Now, let's see the difference between the
microcontroller and microprocessor in terms of the power consumption and the cost. So, in the case of a microprocessor, as all
the memory elements and I/O ports are connected externally, the overall cost of the system,
as well as power consumption, is higher compared to the microcontrollers. So, this is summery of difference between
the microprocessor and a microcontroller based on the various parameters which we have already
discussed. The downloadable link for the same is given
in the description below. So you may check that out. So, before I end up this video, one more thing
which I want to tell you is that you might have observed that when I was discussing the
application of microprocessor, I had given the example of a personal computer. But I didn't mention anything about the smartphone. But if you see the smartphone, it can do almost
all the things which personal computer can do. Like you can play games, you can do web browsing,
you can create the documents etc. on the smartphone. But still, it is not an example of a microprocessor. Because the chip that you find inside the
smartphone is neither microprocessor nor microcontroller. It is sort of combination of both things. And it is known as Sytem On Chip or SOC. So we will discuss about it more in the upcoming
videos. So, I hope in this video you understood the
difference between the microprocessor and microcontroller. ",1263
25,comp_sci,https://youtu.be/dcNk0urQsQM?si=JmQeInvOVLbyJmpD,dcNk0urQsQM,"Supervised and unsupervised learning are two core components in building machine learning models.   So what's the difference? Well, just to cut to the chase: supervised learning, that uses labeled input 
and output data, while an unsupervised learning model doesn't. But what does that really mean? Well, let's better define both learning models, go deeper into the differences between them and then answer the question of which is best for you. Now, in supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm is  trained on a labeled dataset. So this means that each example in the training dataset, the algorithm knows what the correct output is. And the algorithm uses this knowledge to try to generalize to new examples that it's never seen before. Now, using labeled inputs and outputs, the model can measure its accuracy and learn over time. Supervised learning can be actually divided into a couple of subcategories. Firstly, there is a category of classification. And classification talks about whether the output is a discrete class label such as ""spam"" and ""not spam"". Linear classifiers, support vector machines, or SPMs, decision trees, random forests - they're all common examples of classification algorithms. The other example is regression. The output here is a continuous value, such as price or probability.   Linear regression and logistic regression are two common types of regression algorithms. 
   Now, unsupervised learning is where the machine learning algorithm is not really given any labels  at all. And these algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention. They're unsupervised. Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks, such as clustering, association and dimensionality reduction. So let's take a look at each one of those, starting with clustering. Now clustering is where the algorithm groups similar experiences together. So a common application of clustering is customer segmentation, where businesses might group customers together based on similarities like, I don't know, age or location or spending habits, something like that. Then you have association. And association is where the algorithm looks for relationships between variables in the data.   Now association rules are often used in market basket analysis, where businesses want to know  which items are often bought together. You know, something along the lines of, ""customers who bought  this item also bought "",  that sort of thing. The final one to talk about is dimensional ... dimensional reduction. And this is where the algorithm reduces the number of variables in the data, while still preserving as much of the information as possible. Now, often this technique is used in the pre-processing data stage, such as when autoencoders remove noise from visual images to improve picture quality. Okay, so let's talk about the differences between these two types of learning. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from training datasets by iteratively making predictions on the data and then adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they do require all of this up-front human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be on the time of day and thinking about the weather conditions and so forth.   But first you'll have to train it to know things like rainy weather extends the driving time. 
   By contrast, unsupervised learning models work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. These models don't need humans to intervene. They can automatically find patterns in data and group them together. So, for example, an unsupervised learning model can cluster images by the objects they contain - things like people and animals and buildings - without being told what those objects were ahead of time. Now, an important distinction to make is that unsupervised learning models don't make predictions. They only group data together. So if you were to use an unsupervised learning model on that same commute dataset, it would group together commutes with similar conditions 
like the time of day and the weather, but it wouldn't be able to predict how long each commute would take. Okay, so which of these two  options is right for you? In general, supervised learning is more commonly used than unsupervised learning, and that's really because it's more accurate and efficient. But that being said, unsupervised learning has its own advantages. There's two that I can think of. Firstly, unsupervised learning can be used on data that is not labeled, which is often the case in real world datasets. And then secondly, unsupervised learning can be used to find hidden patterns in data that supervised learning models just wouldn't find. Classifying big data can be a real challenge in supervised learning, but the results are highly accurate and trustworthy. And in contrast, unsupervised learning can handle large volumes of data in real time. But there's a lack of transparency into how that data is clustered and a high risk given accurate results. But wait, it is not an ""either/or"" choice. May I present to you the middle ground known as semi-supervised learning. This is, well, a happy medium where you use a training data set with both labeled and unlabeled data. And it's particularly useful when it's difficult to extract relevant features from data when you have a high volume of data. So, for example, you could use a semi-supervised learning algorithm on a data set with millions of images where only a few thousand of those images are actually labeled. Semi-supervised learning is ideal for medical images, where a small amount of training data could lead to a significant improvement in accuracy. For example, a radiologist can look at and label some small subset of CT scans for tumors or diseases, and then the machine can more accurately predict which patients might require more medical attention without going through and labeling the entire set. Machine learning models are a powerful way to gain the data insights that improve our world. The right model for your data depends on the type of data that you have and what you want to do with it. And the choice between supervised and unsupervised learning is only the first step. If you have any questions, please drop us a line below.

26,comp_sci,https://youtu.be/W01tIRP_Rqs?si=Iqrtbd82agAQKn3Q,W01tIRP_Rqs,most of us are likely aware of the major multitasking operating systems or os's that manage our computers these complex pieces of software are designed for powerful hardware and easily capable of running many programs at once since their OS can prioritize Hardware task requests known as system calls and allocate them processing time or memory space as needed and chances are you've already chosen a favorite one but what makes things like pocket size devices tick anyhow or what about the unique electronic systems like the ones found in cars or even the hive-minded robots that will eventually defeat Humanity don't these things need some sort of operating system too yes they do and they actually differ from PC os's in a few key ways we'll start with the ones designed for battery powered devices like phones and tablets these might seem like they should be very different from a desktop OS but thanks to the incredible performance of modern mobile processors top mobile os's including IOS and Android are multitasking operating systems capable of balancing multiple background tasks and user input with Grace and Poise usually but it hasn't always been this way in the early days of mobile Computing battery life and performance were much less plentiful than they are today so the embedded operating systems were King examples of which being Windows CE and pomos they had limited functionality and could only handle one task at a time so by today's standards they'd be considered pretty useless on a phone but my grandpy tells me they were essential for these strange devices called pdas but seriously even though the days of pocket PCS are behind us embedded os's are still essential for many other low powerered limmited functionality devices like media players video cameras GPS units fancy dish washers or even the networking router which is currently allowing you to enjoy this video at certain times though such as when dealing with heavy machinery A System's need to process requests quickly and reliably Will trump its need to be flexible and easy to program for in these instances programmers turn to realtime operating systems a special variety of embedded OS which like their name suggests use specially written scheduling algorithms to ensure that Vital Information is processed in designated orders and within specified time Windows instead of dynamically switching between processes based on resource availability they're very similar to other embedded os's in that they are often developed in tandem with a dedicated piece of Hardware intended to run them and they can be found on shipping stations robotic assembly lines and medical equipment in our vehicles and they're very useful for ensuring that our automatic emergency breake doesn't get stuck behind our seat warmer activation in an OS processing que as we carine directly towards a brick wall Switching gears entirely there's another car thing for you there are operating systems that try to avoid normal Hardware constraints by utilizing network connections to run virtual os's like servers which can operate several systems simultaneously or systems that pool resour between even many more machines at a time the first style templated systems use hypervisors to create several virtual machine images on one extremely high-powered systems which users can then access via a network these machines appear from the outside to be their own dedicated pieces of Hardware but they're not and a second style distributed systems combine and then allocate the resources of many physical machines even over the internet to solve problems like calculating protein folding to help fight diseases uh Shameless plug

29,comp_sci,https://youtu.be/pPStdjuYzSI?si=v3jcB1JrXIDkrPYm,pPStdjuYzSI,"I'm going to attempt to classify all of artificial 
intelligence or AI into seven types. And that's   a tall order. But these seven types of AI 
can largely be understood by examining two   encompassing categories. There's AI capabilities, 
and there's AI functionalities. So let's start   with AI capabilities, and there are three. The 
first of which is known as artificial narrow AI,   which also goes by the rather unflattering name of 
""weak AI"". Now, on its face, that doesn't sound like   a very interesting capability to start us off. 
But actually, narrow AI is the only type of AI   that exists today--it's all we currently have. Any 
other form of AI is theoretical. So we can think   of this as realized AI--that's the artificial 
intelligence we have today. And theoretical AI,   which is the artificial intelligence we may have 
in the future. And now narrow AI can be trained   to perform a narrow task, which, to be fair 
to narrow AI, might be something that a human   could not do as well as the AI can. But it can't 
perform outside of its defined task. It does need   us humans still to train it. So if narrow AI 
represents all AI capabilities we have today,   well, what else is there? Well, a favorite of 
memes, science fiction, and betting markets is   artificial general intelligence, also known as 
AGI. And also known as ""strong AI"". To be clear,   AGI is currently nothing more than a theoretical 
concept. But here's the idea: AGI can use previous   learnings and skills to accomplish new tasks 
in a different context, without the need for   us human beings to train the underlying models. 
If AGI wants to learn how to perform a new task,   it will figure it out by itself. Which 
sounds... disconcerting. But, but look,   we haven't even talked about the third type of AI 
capability yet. And that's artificial ""super AI"". If   ever realized, super AI would think, reason, 
learn, make judgments and possess cognitive   abilities that surpass those of human beings. 
The application's [possessing] super AI capabilities   would have evolved beyond the point of catering 
to humans sentiments and experiences, and would be   able to feel emotions and have needs and possess 
beliefs and desires of their own. Yeah. So let's   park that cheery thought for now, and consider 
the four types of AI based on functionalities.   And we're back in the real world of realized 
AI here--at least initially. So we can think   of narrow AI as having two fundamental functions. 
One of those is reactive machine AI. Now reactive   machine AI are systems designed to perform a very 
specific specialized task. Reactive AI stems from   statistical math, and it can analyze vast amounts 
of data to produce a seemingly intelligent output.   We've had reactive AI for quite a long time. Back 
in the late 1990s, IBM's chess playing supercomputer   Deep Blue beat chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov by 
analyzing the pieces on the board and predicting   the probable outcomes of each move. That's a 
specialized task with a lot of available data   to create insights. The hallmark of reactive AI. 
We can think of other narrow AI functionalities   really as being classified as ""limited memory 
AI"". Now this form of AI can recall past events   and outcomes and monitor specific objects or 
situations over time. It can use past and present   moment data to decide on a course of action most 
likely to help achieve a desired outcome. And as   it's trained on more data over time, limited 
memory AI can improve in performance. Think of   your favorite generative AI chatbot, which relies 
on limited memory AI capabilities to predict the   next word or the next phrase or the next visual 
element within the context it's generating. Okay,   so what about our two theoretical AI capabilities? 
Well, if we look at AGI, we have to think about   ""theory of mind AI"". Now, this would understand 
the thoughts and emotions of other entities,   specifically us, so it could infer human motives 
and reasoning and personalize its interactions   with individuals based on their unique emotional 
needs and intentions. And actually, emotion AI   is a theory of mind AI currently in development. 
AI researchers hope it will have the ability to   analyze voices, images and other kinds of data 
to understand and respond to human feelings.   Finally! An AI that really understands me. And 
then finally, under super AI, we have ""self-aware   AI"". Winning my personal award for the scariest AI 
of all, it would have the ability to understand   its own internal conditions and traits, leading to 
its own set of emotions, needs and beliefs. Look,   we've covered seven types of AI, and only three 
of them actually exist today! There is still so   much to be learned and discovered. But as 
those advancements happen, at least here we   have a taxonomy of AI types that will tell 
us how far along we are on our AI journey. ",825
